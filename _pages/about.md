I hold a Bachelor's (2022) and Master's (2023) degree in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). I'm a member of the [MACRO Research Group](https://macro.eng.ufmg.br/), where we explore topics in control theory, robotics, and autonomous systems. I am currently a Ph.D. student at UFMG, continuing my research in geometric and mathematical methods for robot control and motion planning.

My [Master's research](https://fbartelt.github.io/publications/#theses) focused on extending guidance vector fields&mdash;originally proposed for path following in Euclidean spaces&mdash;to Lie groups. This generalization allows us to define vector fields directly on spaces like SE(3), enabling more natural control strategies for systems whose configurations include both position and orientation.

Currently, in my Ph.D., I'm shifting toward path planning. Iâ€™m investigating smooth approximations of distance functions and their application to trajectory deformation and homotopy-based methods. My broader interests include kinematic control, geometric approaches to motion planning, and the interface between control theory and machine learning (though the latter remains more of a curiosity than an active research area at the moment).
